  # NAME

  File::chmod::Recursive - Run chmod
  recursively against directories

  # DESCRIPTION

  Like File::chmod, but recursive with
  selective permissions

  # SYNOPSIS

  use File::chmod::Recursive; # Exports
  'chmod_recursive' by default

  # Apply identical permissions to
  everything # Similar to chmod -R
  chmod_recursive( 0755,
  '/path/to/directory' );

  # Apply permissions selectively
  chmod_recursive( { dirs => 0755, #
  Mode for directories files => 0644, #
  Mode for files

  # Match both directories and files
  match => { qr/.sh|.pl/ => 0755,
  qr/.gnupg/ => 0600, },

  # You can also match files or
  directories selectively match_dirs =>
  { qr//logs// => 0775, }, match_files
  => { qr//bin/+$/ => 0755, }, },
  '/path/to/directory' );

  # FUNCTIONS

  - chmod_recursive(MODE, $path) -
  chmod_recursive(%options, $path)

  This function accepts two parameters.
  The first is either a MODE or an
  options hashref. The second is the
  directory to work on. It returns the
  number of files successfully changed,
  similar to chmod.

  When using a hashref for selective
  permissions, the following options
  are valid -

  { dirs => MODE, # Default Mode for
  directories files => MODE, # Default
  Mode for files

  # Match both directories and files
  match => { qr// => MODE, },

  # Match files only match_files => {
  qr// => MODE, },

  # Match directories only match_dirs
  => { qr// => MODE, },

  # Follow symlinks. OFF by default
  follow_symlinks => 0,

  # Depth first tree walking. ON by
  default (default find behavior)
  depth_first => 1, }

  In all cases the MODE is whatever
  File::chmod accepts.
