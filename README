NAME
    File::chmod::Recursive

DESCRIPTION
    Run chmod recursively against directories

SYNOPSIS
        use File::chmod::Recursive;  # Exports 'chmod_recursive' by default

        # Apply identical permissions to everything
        #   Similar to chmod -R
        chmod_recursive( 0755, '/path/to/directory' );

        # Apply permissions selectively
        chmod_recursive(
            {
                dirs  => 0755,       # Mode for directories
                files => 0644,       # Mode for files
                match => {
                    qr/\.sh|\.pl/ => 0755,  # Mode for executables
                    qr/\.key/     => 0600,  # Secure files

                    # Note: Matching applies to both directories and files
                },
            },
            '/path/to/directory'
        );

FUNCTIONS
    chmod_recursive(MODE, $path)
    chmod_recursive(\%options, $path)
        This function accepts two parameters. The first is either a *MODE*
        or an *options hashref*. The second is the directory to work on. It
        returns the number of files successfully changed, similar to chmod.

        When using a *hashref* for selective permissions, the following
        options are valid -

            {
                dirs  => MODE,       # Required. Mode for directories
                files => MODE,       # Required. Mode for files
                match => {           # Optional.
                    qr/<some condition>/ => MODE,
                # Note: Matching applies to both directories and files
                },
            }
    
        In all cases the *MODE* is whatever File::chmod accepts.
